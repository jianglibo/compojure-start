Beside DOM differences, React offers some attributes that simply don't exist in DOM.

key: an optional, unique identifier. When your component shuffles around during render passes, it might be destroyed and recreated due to the diff algorithm. Assigning it a key that persists makes sure the component stays. See more here.
ref: see here.
dangerouslySetInnerHTML: takes an object with the key __html and a DOM string as value. This is mainly for cooperating with DOM string manipulation libraries. Refer to the last example on the front page.
